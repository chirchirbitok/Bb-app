#AWeb Based Application for Managing the Kenya Basketball

This project was concerned with sharing of basketball statistics after the end
of each game. The system will be able to calculate the statistics of players and teams
standings automatically after every game played. The system will ensure all recorded
data is stored in the data base. The system should enable secretaries to register and
have an access to the system. It is going to be a key element to prepare player and
entertain viewers from each results thus bringing support of the game from people
and sponsors. Due to simplification of the content and creating of access point for all
resources, the user experience and players will be greatly improved.
