			<p>After a scintillating night of drama and action on opening night in the NBA there are a host of teams in action on the second day of the 2017/18 season. Kwesé Sports is the home of the NBA on the African continent and there are three games coming to your screens early on Thursday morning.</p>
			<p>There are African players littered across the league on Wednesday night/Thursday morning and we have picked out who to look out for with all of the games on Kwesé Sports 1.</p>
			<p><b>Miami Heat v Orlando Magic</b></p>
			<p>The battle of Florida is taking place in Orlando as the Magic host the Heat in their season opening game. Congolese star Bismack Biyombo and African teammates</p>
			<p>The battle of Florida is taking place in Orlando as the Magic host the Heat in their season opening game. Congolese star Bismack Biyombo and African teammates</p>
			<p>Evan Fournier (Algerian-French) and Wesley Iwundu (Nigerian-American) welcome a Heat team that features Edrice ‘Bam’ Adebayo (Nigerian-American) to Amway Center. The Heat just missed out on the Playoffs last season as coach Erik Spoelstra got his team to gel late in the season. They now head into the new campaign looking to make it back into the postseason and Adebayo will form part of those plans. He will match his strength against that of Biyombo’s during the game and will want to make a solid impression. The Magic need to improve after a below-par season last time out. Biyombo will be critical to that success and he will be more than motivated to get back to his sparkling best.</p>
			<p>The game tips off at 01:00 CAT on Kwesé Sports 1</p>
			<p><b>Houston Rockets v Sacramento Kings</b></p>
			<p>The Houston Rockets are on the road again after having beaten the champions the Golden State Warriors in their season opener on Wednesday morning. They now face another Californian franchise in the Sacramento Kings. The Kings are a team filled with huge potential as they have some youthful players on their roster. Buddy Hield is expected to lead them as the starting point guard and he has a lot to prove this season. He’s joined by rookie De’Aaron Fox who is fast as lightning but untested at this level. Add veterans Vince Carter and Zach Randolph to the mix and you have a good mix that could upset a few teams. However the Rockets have hit the ground running. Victory over the Warriors was hard fought and earned with sweat. James Harden is already back to his enigmatic best and Chris Paul is adjusting to his new surroundings quickly. The Rockets can also count on their African stars to make a splash with Luc Mbah a Moute (Cameroonian) and Clint Capela (Angolan/Congolese-Swiss) having already put their hands up to be noticed in their first game. Chinanu Onuaku (Nigerian-American)didn’t feature in the first game but could see some minutes in the second game on the road</p>
			<p>This games tips off at 04:00 and will air on Kwesé Sports 1.</p>
